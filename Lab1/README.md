1. What is Git?
Git is a local Version Control System (VCS). It is software that you install on your computer to track changes in your code files over time.

The "Undo" Button: It allows you to take "snapshots" (commits) of your work. If you break something, you can revert to a previous version.

Branching: You can create separate branches to test new features without messing up the main project code.

Offline: You don't need an internet connection to use Git; it lives entirely on your hard drive.

2. What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It is a website where you upload your Git projects so you can share them with others or access them from different devices.

The Social Network for Code: It adds a layer of collaboration. Developers can "pull" your code, suggest changes, and "push" updates back.

Project Management: It provides tools like "Issue Tracking," "Pull Requests," and "GitHub Actions" (automation) that Git doesn't have on its own.

Online: You need an internet connection to interact with GitHub.

Summary
To put it simply:

Git is the engine that tracks your progress.

GitHub is the garage where you park your engine and show it to the world.
